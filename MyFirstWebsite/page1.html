<h1 id="page1H1">git, The Stupid Content Tracker</h1>

<p id="page1Text" style="font-size:25px"><b> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to 
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br><br>
Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 after BitKeeper, the previous Version Control System, which the Linux Community used between 2002-2005,
had become a paid service instead of being free-to-use. <br><br>
This prompted Torvalds to create his own VCS (Version Control System) since there was no existing system that would've met his requirements. <br>
Some the goals of the project were: </b></p>

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Speed</b></p></li>
	<li><p><b>Simple design</b></p></li>
	<li><p><b>Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)</b></p></li>
	<li><p><b>Fully distributed </b></p></li>
	<li><p><b>Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)</b></p></li>
</ul>

<p id="page1Text2" style="font-size:25px"><b> Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet 
retain these initial qualities. It's amazingly fast, it's very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development. <br><br>
The origin of the name "git" is that the program needed a name that was not used in existing Unix-software and according to Torvalds, 
it's a "stupid content tracker" and it can be "Global Information Tracker" when you are in good mood and everything works correctly or 
"Goddamn Idiotic Truckload of sh*t" when it does not work. </b></p>
